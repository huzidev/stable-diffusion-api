first of all creating caption of images using blib captioning from utilities then BLIP Captioning
paste the folder name where images are present then prefix to add blip add the name of the person just
ex: Thommas shelby
then caption images

now select the custom model on Dreambooth and Dreambooth-lora on which images have to be trained IF models base is SD 2 or 2.1 then select v2 and v_prameterization checkbox
now folders create three diff folders 1:image, 2:log 3:model in image folder create a folder with training steps
100_tom in which all the images with generated captioms
now copy the folder with the name image NOT 100_tom just folder (image) copy as path paste at image folder tab in dreambooth-lora->folders->image folder
and copy model folder path and paste in output folder and log folder path in logging folder
now training parameters their is JSON file with all the best training settings load that file with Configuration file at top then load
make sure to check the folders name again as the folder path may be changed after loadign the settings
Train batch size maybe 2 which takes too much vram select it to be 1

while training lora if total images are less than 15 than do this
suppose we've 10 images to train
1500/10 = 150 now the folder name must've to be 150_test
minimum training steps must be 100 and this method will only be followed when we've less than 15 images
